## Introduction

**RedBazaar** is a B2B platform designed to connect restaurants and suppliers, focusing on fostering trade between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The platform aims to provide a professional, centralized tool that simplifies the ordering process for restaurants, helping them save time, reduce product waste, and cut costs. For suppliers, especially smaller ones, RedBazaar offers increased visibility, making it easier to reach potential customers in a competitive market.

This idea emerged from a personal experience while working in a caf√©, where I observed the inefficiencies of managing orders through multiple platforms. RedBazaar solves this problem by grouping all suppliers under one platform, enabling restaurants to search for products rather than being tied to a specific supplier. For example, if a restaurant needs chicken strips, the platform displays all available options from various suppliers, allowing the business to choose the best deal.

Looking ahead, RedBazaar plans to introduce features that will enhance efficiency and flexibility for both restaurants and suppliers. Future updates will include tools for creating optimised shopping lists, finding the best-priced products, and promoting daily offers from suppliers. By focusing on affordability and accessibility, RedBazaar aims to build a community that empowers SMEs to thrive in the digital marketplace.


## Features

RedBazaar is currently in its initial development phase, providing the core functionality required to facilitate seamless transactions between buyers (restaurants) and suppliers. The platform is focused on delivering a simple and effective e-commerce experience, ensuring it meets the minimum viable product requirements. 

At this stage, RedBazaar includes the following features:
- **Product Search:** Restaurants can browse available products across multiple suppliers.
- **Shopping Cart and Transactions:** Buyers can add products to a shopping cart and complete purchases directly through the website.
- **Order Management:** Suppliers receive detailed orders submitted by buyers, including all necessary information to fulfil the requests.
- **Order Status Updates:** Suppliers can update the status of orders, providing real-time visibility for buyers about their purchases.
- **Messaging System:**  Buyers and suppliers can communicate directly through a secure and efficient messaging system, allowing for clarification of order details, requests, or any additional information.

While the current state focuses on essential functionality, it sets the foundation for future enhancements that will make the platform more dynamic, efficient, and user-friendly.

### Database Schema

The database schema is designed to support the core functionalities of the project, including user management, product listings, order processing, and messaging between users. Below is the relational diagram illustrating the relationships between the key entities:

![Database Schema](red-bazaar/static/imgs/readme-pics/DB-schema-BuyNSell.jpg)

#### Key Highlights:
- **Users**: Managed through the `CustomUser` table, which differentiates between Buyers and Suppliers. Each user can have a detailed profile linked via the `Profile` table.
- **Products and Categories**: Products are linked to Suppliers and organised into hierarchical categories using the `Category` table.
- **Orders**: The `Order` table connects Buyers and Suppliers, storing details like order status and shipping information. Each order contains multiple items managed by the `OrderItem` table.
- **Messages**: Private messaging between users is handled through the `Message` table, tracking sender, recipient, and read status.

## Colours

The colour scheme used in this project is carefully designed to reflect the branding of "Red Bazaar," ensuring a visually engaging yet professional appearance. The primary colours are inspired by shades of red, reinforcing the connection to the project's name and logo. Secondary colours like greys and whites provide balance and readability, creating a polished user experience.

### Purpose and Implementation

- **Bootstrap Overwrite**: The colours are implemented using CSS variables defined under the `:root` selector. This ensures they overwrite Bootstrap's default styles seamlessly, maintaining a consistent design across all components.
- **Centralised Control**: By defining the colours in the root, any future changes can be applied globally, affecting the entire project without needing individual updates to components.
- **Professional Design**: The palette prioritises accessibility and clarity, combining bold reds for identity and soft greys for neutral elements.

### Colour Palette

![Colour Scheme](red-bazaar/static/imgs/readme-pics/colour-scheme.png)

1. **`--colour-primary-light`**: `#f8d7da`  
   - A soft, light red used for subtle highlights and less critical notifications. This tone ensures a visual connection to the branding while maintaining readability.

2. **`--colour-primary`**: `#b71c1c`  
   - A bold, rich red that represents the core identity of "Red Bazaar." It is used in headers, buttons, and other key elements to reinforce the branding.

3. **`--colour-primary-dark`**: `#7f0000`  
   - A deeper red providing contrast and depth, used for hover effects or active states to indicate interactivity.

4. **`--colour-secondary-light`**: `#f5f5f5`  
   - A very light grey, ideal for backgrounds and creating a clean, professional look while maintaining a soft contrast with text.

    - A muted grey tone for secondary information or less important content, maintaining a clear hierarchy in the design.


### Colour Customization Process

Currently, the colour scheme of the website is fixed and cannot be customised by users. There are no options to switch between different themes or adjust the colour palette according to user preferences. Additionally, the platform does not support a dark mode or light mode toggle; the website operates in a single predefined mode.

#### Future Plans
While there are no immediate plans to allow users to change the colour scheme entirely, we aim to implement a dark mode in the future to accommodate user preferences for a darker interface. However, this will be done in a way that preserves the branding of "Red Bazaar" and aligns with the existing colour scheme and logo.

#### Rationale
The fixed colour scheme ensures consistency with the branding and identity of "Red Bazaar." Allowing users to fully customise the colours could compromise the visual connection to the project's name and logo, which are integral to the platform's identity. As such, any future changes or customisation features will carefully consider this balance.

## How It Works

This section provides an overview of the core functionality and user workflows within the platform. The diagram below illustrates the interaction between Buyers and Suppliers, highlighting the key processes, such as user registration, product management, order placement, and messaging.

### Key Processes:
1. **User Registration and Login**: Users can sign up as Buyers or Suppliers and access role-specific features after logging in.
2. **Product Management**: Suppliers can add, edit, and delete their products, while Buyers can browse and search for products by category or name.
3. **Order Placement and Management**: Buyers can place orders, and Suppliers can view and update order statuses.
4. **Messaging System**: Both Buyers and Suppliers can communicate directly through a secure messaging system.
5. **Payment Processing**: Buyers can securely complete transactions using Stripe integration.

Below is the flowchart representing these processes:

![Platform Workflow](red-bazaar/static/imgs/readme-pics/fc-webusage.jpg)


## User Experience

### Key Principles

1. **User-Centric Design**  
   The platform is designed to cater to two main user groups: Suppliers managing their products and Buyers exploring and purchasing them. The experience is streamlined for both roles, ensuring efficiency and ease of use.

2. **Role-Specific Navigation**  
   The interface dynamically adapts based on the user‚Äôs role, providing Buyers with features such as product browsing and cart management, while offering Suppliers tools to manage products and track orders.

3. **Clear and Intuitive Interaction**  
   Every action, from creating a product to completing a purchase, provides immediate feedback to the user, ensuring clarity and confidence in their interactions.

4. **Responsive and Accessible**  
   The platform is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices and screen sizes. Accessibility has been considered to accommodate diverse user needs.

5. **Effective Communication**  
   A built-in messaging system enables seamless communication between Buyers and Suppliers, with clear indicators for unread messages to ensure important communications are not missed.

6. **Organised and Searchable Content**  
   Products are categorised and searchable by name or category, making it easy for Buyers to find what they need. The shopping cart and product listings are organised by Supplier for clarity.

7. **Secure and Reliable Transactions**  
   Payments are processed securely using Stripe in test mode. The platform validates all payment and billing details to prevent errors and ensure a smooth checkout process.

8. **Transparency and Feedback**  
   The system provides clear and transparent feedback for all user actions, whether it‚Äôs a success message for an order or detailed error information for debugging.

- **Smart Price Comparison Wizard:** A tool designed to help buyers optimise their shopping lists by identifying the best deals based on price, supplier ratings, or other preferences.
- **Calendar-Based Insights:** Both buyers and suppliers will have access to a calendar feature that leverages historical data:
  - Buyers will receive reminders about past purchases, such as increased orders for specific products during seasonal events, helping them plan more effectively.
  - Suppliers will be notified of past periods of high demand, allowing them to adjust their inventory, prepare special offers, or target specific customers more strategically.
- **Enhanced Supplier Visibility:** Suppliers will have the ability to promote their products and daily deals, ensuring maximum exposure on the platform.
- **API for Market Insights:** A free API will provide valuable analytics and trends for both buyers and suppliers, helping them make informed business decisions.

## Current State and Future Plans

### Current State

RedBazaar is currently at its **minimum viable product (MVP)** stage, focusing on the essential features required to operate as an e-commerce platform. The project has been developed with a clear goal of delivering a functional foundation that allows seamless interactions between buyers (restaurants) and suppliers. This ensures the platform is ready for further development and expansion.

The current implementation includes the following core features:

1. **Product Search**  
   Restaurants can search and browse products across multiple suppliers, filtering by category or product name to locate items quickly.

2. **Shopping Cart and Transactions**  
   Buyers can add products to their cart, review their selection, and complete purchases securely using Stripe.

3. **Order Management**  
   Suppliers receive detailed orders, including product quantities, shipping addresses, and total costs, enabling them to fulfil buyer requests efficiently.

4. **Order Status Updates**  
   Suppliers can update the status of orders (e.g., Pending, Shipped, Delivered), providing real-time visibility for buyers regarding their purchases.

5. **Messaging System**  
   Buyers and suppliers can communicate directly through a secure messaging system, clarifying order details or addressing post-order inquiries.

6. **Responsive Design**  
   The platform is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

7. **Role-Specific Navigation**  
   The interface adjusts dynamically based on the user's role. Buyers can browse products, manage orders, and track purchases, while Suppliers can manage product listings and process orders.

This stage provides a solid starting point for the project, demonstrating a functioning e-commerce platform with key features in place. While it represents the minimum necessary to achieve this goal, the project is well-structured for future enhancements.

### Future Plans

Building on the current foundation, RedBazaar aims to implement additional features and improvements to enhance the platform‚Äôs functionality, usability, and scalability. These plans include:

1. **Dark Mode Support**  
   Introduce a dark mode option to accommodate user preferences and improve accessibility in low-light environments.

2. **Advanced Search Filters**  
   Allow users to filter products by criteria such as price range, availability, and ratings, improving the browsing experience.

3. **Order Analytics for Suppliers**  
   Provide suppliers with detailed analytics on order trends, product performance, and buyer behaviour, helping them optimise their offerings.

4. **Enhanced Messaging Features**  
   Expand the messaging system to include features like file attachments, read receipts, and group conversations for more robust communication.

5. **Customisable User Profiles**  
   Enable users to personalise their profiles, including adding profile pictures and setting preferences for notifications and communication.

6. **Multi-Currency and Multi-Language Support**  
   Broaden the platform's reach by supporting multiple currencies and languages to cater to a global audience.

7. **Mobile Application**  
   Develop a dedicated mobile app to provide users with an optimised experience on mobile devices.

### Moving Forward

With the foundation established, the focus now shifts to enhancing the platform through the planned features above. Each step will be carefully implemented to ensure consistency with the branding and goals of RedBazaar, while incorporating user feedback to guide development. This forward-thinking approach positions RedBazaar as a scalable and adaptable solution for buyers and suppliers in the e-commerce space.


## Deployment

### **Local Deployment Guide**

#### **1. Clone the Repository**
Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vgarcan/CodeInstitute-proj04-b2b.git
```

#### **2. Navigate to the Project Directory**
Move into the project directory:
```bash
cd CodeInstitute-proj04-b2b
```

---

#### **3. Set Up a Virtual Environment**
It‚Äôs recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

- **On Windows:**
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **On macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

**Tip:** If you encounter issues activating the virtual environment, ensure Python is installed and accessible via your system's PATH.

---

#### **4. Install Dependencies**
With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Tip:** If you see errors during installation, ensure you have the latest version of `pip`:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

#### **5. Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the project‚Äôs root directory and configure the necessary environment variables. An example configuration might look like this:

```plaintext
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email_address
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_password
```

**Tips for Environment Variables:**
- Make sure your `SECRET_KEY` is a secure, random string.
- Use the appropriate `DATABASE_URL` for your local database setup (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
- If using Stripe in test mode, ensure you use test keys, which are prefixed with `sk_test_` (secret key) and `pk_test_` (public key).

---

#### **6. Apply Database Migrations**
Run the following commands to apply database migrations and prepare the database:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

**Tip:** If migrations fail, check your `DATABASE_URL` and ensure your database server is running locally.

---

#### **7. Create a Superuser (Optional)**
To access the Django admin panel, create a superuser account:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to set up a username, email, and password.

---

#### **8. Load Initial Data (Optional)**
If the project includes fixtures or pre-defined data, load them into the database:
```bash
python manage.py loaddata fixtures.json
```

**Tip:** Ensure the `fixtures.json` file exists in the project and is correctly formatted.

---

#### **9. Run the Development Server**
Start the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser to view the application.

---

#### **Troubleshooting Tips**

- **Dependencies Fail to Install**:
  - Ensure your Python version matches the project's requirements (e.g., Python 3.8+).
  - Check for compatibility issues with installed system libraries (e.g., `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL).

- **Environment Variable Issues**:
  - Double-check the `.env` file formatting; it should not contain extra spaces or special characters.
  - Ensure the `.env` file is in the root project directory.

- **Database Errors**:
  - Ensure the database server (e.g., PostgreSQL) is running if using an external database.
  - Verify the `DATABASE_URL` format:
    ```plaintext
    postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DBNAME
    ```

- **Server Fails to Start**:
  - Check for syntax errors or missing modules.
  - Ensure all migrations have been applied:
    ```bash
    python manage.py showmigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

- **Static Files Not Loading**:
  - Run the following command to collect static files locally:
    ```bash
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```
