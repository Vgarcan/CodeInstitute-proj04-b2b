## Introduction

**RedBazaar** is a B2B platform designed to connect restaurants and suppliers, focusing on fostering trade between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The platform aims to provide a professional, centralized tool that simplifies the ordering process for restaurants, helping them save time, reduce product waste, and cut costs. For suppliers, especially smaller ones, RedBazaar offers increased visibility, making it easier to reach potential customers in a competitive market.

This idea emerged from a personal experience while working in a caf√©, where I observed the inefficiencies of managing orders through multiple platforms. RedBazaar solves this problem by grouping all suppliers under one platform, enabling restaurants to search for products rather than being tied to a specific supplier. For example, if a restaurant needs chicken strips, the platform displays all available options from various suppliers, allowing the business to choose the best deal.

Looking ahead, RedBazaar plans to introduce features that will enhance efficiency and flexibility for both restaurants and suppliers. Future updates will include tools for creating optimised shopping lists, finding the best-priced products, and promoting daily offers from suppliers. By focusing on affordability and accessibility, RedBazaar aims to build a community that empowers SMEs to thrive in the digital marketplace.


## Features

RedBazaar is currently in its initial development phase, providing the core functionality required to facilitate seamless transactions between buyers (restaurants) and suppliers. The platform is focused on delivering a simple and effective e-commerce experience, ensuring it meets the minimum viable product requirements. 

At this stage, RedBazaar includes the following features:
- **Product Search:** Restaurants can browse available products across multiple suppliers.
- **Shopping Cart and Transactions:** Buyers can add products to a shopping cart and complete purchases directly through the website.
- **Order Management:** Suppliers receive detailed orders submitted by buyers, including all necessary information to fulfil the requests.
- **Order Status Updates:** Suppliers can update the status of orders, providing real-time visibility for buyers about their purchases.

While the current state focuses on essential functionality, it sets the foundation for future enhancements that will make the platform more dynamic, efficient, and user-friendly.
## Development Tools

RedBazaar is being developed using a set of tools that streamline the coding, version control, and deployment processes. These tools ensure that development adheres to best practices and allows for efficient collaboration and deployment.

- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode):**  
  The primary IDE used for writing and managing the code. VSCode is enhanced with extensions such as:
  - **autoPEP8:** Automatically formats the code to comply with the PEP8 standard, ensuring clean and readable Python code.

- **Git:**  
  Used for version control, enabling the tracking of changes to the codebase and facilitating collaboration among developers.

- **GitHub:**  
  The repository for hosting the project, allowing for remote collaboration, issue tracking, and streamlined version management.

- **pip and `requirements.txt`:**  
  pip is used for managing project dependencies, with all necessary libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file for easy installation and environment setup.

- **Heroku:**  
  The platform used for deploying the project. Heroku allows for quick and scalable deployment, making it easy to share and test the application in a live environment.


## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Django:**  
  The primary framework used for building the backend of RedBazaar. Django handles the server-side logic, routing, and database interactions. It also includes a built-in authentication system for managing user registration and login.

- **Python:**  
  The core programming language for RedBazaar, used in conjunction with Django to build robust and scalable server-side functionality.

- **Django ORM and Database:**  
  Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is used for database operations. The database structure is managed entirely through Django, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

- **Django MPTT:**  
  This library is used for managing hierarchical data, particularly in creating parent and child categories for the products. It helps organise the categories into tree structures for better usability and data representation.

- **Django AllAuth:**  
  A library integrated for user authentication, registration, and login. It supports third-party authentication providers like Google and GitHub, allowing users to register with a single click.

### Frontend

- **HTML5:**  
  Used to structure the content of the website, ensuring semantic and accessible markup.

- **CSS3:**  
  Utilised to style the website, providing consistent and responsive designs across different devices.

- **JavaScript:**  
  Enhances interactivity on the site by enabling dynamic content updates and user interactions.

- **Bootstrap:**  
  A popular front-end framework that helps create responsive and visually appealing designs. Bootstrap is used for layout management, navigation bars, modals, and other UI components.

### Database Schema

The database schema is designed to support the core functionalities of the project, including user management, product listings, order processing, and messaging between users. Below is the relational diagram illustrating the relationships between the key entities:

![Database Schema](red-bazaar/static/imgs/readme-pics/DB-schema-BuyNSell.jpg)

#### Key Highlights:
- **Users**: Managed through the `CustomUser` table, which differentiates between Buyers and Suppliers. Each user can have a detailed profile linked via the `Profile` table.
- **Products and Categories**: Products are linked to Suppliers and organised into hierarchical categories using the `Category` table.
- **Orders**: The `Order` table connects Buyers and Suppliers, storing details like order status and shipping information. Each order contains multiple items managed by the `OrderItem` table.
- **Messages**: Private messaging between users is handled through the `Message` table, tracking sender, recipient, and read status.

## How It Works

This section provides an overview of the core functionality and user workflows within the platform. The diagram below illustrates the interaction between Buyers and Suppliers, highlighting the key processes, such as user registration, product management, order placement, and messaging.

### Key Processes:
1. **User Registration and Login**: Users can sign up as Buyers or Suppliers and access role-specific features after logging in.
2. **Product Management**: Suppliers can add, edit, and delete their products, while Buyers can browse and search for products by category or name.
3. **Order Placement and Management**: Buyers can place orders, and Suppliers can view and update order statuses.
4. **Messaging System**: Both Buyers and Suppliers can communicate directly through a secure messaging system.
5. **Payment Processing**: Buyers can securely complete transactions using Stripe integration.

Below is the flowchart representing these processes:

![Platform Workflow](red-bazaar/static/imgs/readme-pics/fc-webusage.jpg)


## User Experience

### Key Principles

1. **User-Centric Design**  
   The platform is designed to cater to two main user groups: Suppliers managing their products and Buyers exploring and purchasing them. The experience is streamlined for both roles, ensuring efficiency and ease of use.

2. **Role-Specific Navigation**  
   The interface dynamically adapts based on the user‚Äôs role, providing Buyers with features such as product browsing and cart management, while offering Suppliers tools to manage products and track orders.

3. **Clear and Intuitive Interaction**  
   Every action, from creating a product to completing a purchase, provides immediate feedback to the user, ensuring clarity and confidence in their interactions.

4. **Responsive and Accessible**  
   The platform is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices and screen sizes. Accessibility has been considered to accommodate diverse user needs.

5. **Effective Communication**  
   A built-in messaging system enables seamless communication between Buyers and Suppliers, with clear indicators for unread messages to ensure important communications are not missed.

6. **Organised and Searchable Content**  
   Products are categorised and searchable by name or category, making it easy for Buyers to find what they need. The shopping cart and product listings are organised by Supplier for clarity.

7. **Secure and Reliable Transactions**  
   Payments are processed securely using Stripe in test mode. The platform validates all payment and billing details to prevent errors and ensure a smooth checkout process.

8. **Transparency and Feedback**  
   The system provides clear and transparent feedback for all user actions, whether it‚Äôs a success message for an order or detailed error information for debugging.

## Deployment

### **Local Deployment Guide**

#### **1. Clone the Repository**
Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vgarcan/CodeInstitute-proj04-b2b.git
```

#### **2. Navigate to the Project Directory**
Move into the project directory:
```bash
cd CodeInstitute-proj04-b2b
```

---

#### **3. Set Up a Virtual Environment**
It‚Äôs recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

- **On Windows:**
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **On macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

**Tip:** If you encounter issues activating the virtual environment, ensure Python is installed and accessible via your system's PATH.

---

#### **4. Install Dependencies**
With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Tip:** If you see errors during installation, ensure you have the latest version of `pip`:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

#### **5. Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the project‚Äôs root directory and configure the necessary environment variables. An example configuration might look like this:

```plaintext
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email_address
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_password
```

**Tips for Environment Variables:**
- Make sure your `SECRET_KEY` is a secure, random string.
- Use the appropriate `DATABASE_URL` for your local database setup (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
- If using Stripe in test mode, ensure you use test keys, which are prefixed with `sk_test_` (secret key) and `pk_test_` (public key).

---

#### **6. Apply Database Migrations**
Run the following commands to apply database migrations and prepare the database:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

**Tip:** If migrations fail, check your `DATABASE_URL` and ensure your database server is running locally.

---

#### **7. Create a Superuser (Optional)**
To access the Django admin panel, create a superuser account:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to set up a username, email, and password.

---

#### **8. Load Initial Data (Optional)**
If the project includes fixtures or pre-defined data, load them into the database:
```bash
python manage.py loaddata fixtures.json
```

**Tip:** Ensure the `fixtures.json` file exists in the project and is correctly formatted.

---

#### **9. Run the Development Server**
Start the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser to view the application.

---

#### **Troubleshooting Tips**

- **Dependencies Fail to Install**:
  - Ensure your Python version matches the project's requirements (e.g., Python 3.8+).
  - Check for compatibility issues with installed system libraries (e.g., `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL).

- **Environment Variable Issues**:
  - Double-check the `.env` file formatting; it should not contain extra spaces or special characters.
  - Ensure the `.env` file is in the root project directory.

- **Database Errors**:
  - Ensure the database server (e.g., PostgreSQL) is running if using an external database.
  - Verify the `DATABASE_URL` format:
    ```plaintext
    postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DBNAME
    ```

- **Server Fails to Start**:
  - Check for syntax errors or missing modules.
  - Ensure all migrations have been applied:
    ```bash
    python manage.py showmigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

- **Static Files Not Loading**:
  - Run the following command to collect static files locally:
    ```bash
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```
