## Introduction

**RedBazaar** is a B2B platform designed to connect restaurants and suppliers, focusing on fostering trade between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The platform aims to provide a professional, centralized tool that simplifies the ordering process for restaurants, helping them save time, reduce product waste, and cut costs. For suppliers, especially smaller ones, RedBazaar offers increased visibility, making it easier to reach potential customers in a competitive market.

This idea emerged from a personal experience while working in a caf√©, where I observed the inefficiencies of managing orders through multiple platforms. RedBazaar solves this problem by grouping all suppliers under one platform, enabling restaurants to search for products rather than being tied to a specific supplier. For example, if a restaurant needs chicken strips, the platform displays all available options from various suppliers, allowing the business to choose the best deal.

Looking ahead, RedBazaar plans to introduce features that will enhance efficiency and flexibility for both restaurants and suppliers. Future updates will include tools for creating optimised shopping lists, finding the best-priced products, and promoting daily offers from suppliers. By focusing on affordability and accessibility, RedBazaar aims to build a community that empowers SMEs to thrive in the digital marketplace.


## Features

RedBazaar is currently in its initial development phase, providing the core functionality required to facilitate seamless transactions between buyers (restaurants) and suppliers. The platform is focused on delivering a simple and effective e-commerce experience, ensuring it meets the minimum viable product requirements. 

At this stage, RedBazaar includes the following features:
- **Product Search:** Restaurants can browse available products across multiple suppliers.
- **Shopping Cart and Transactions:** Buyers can add products to a shopping cart and complete purchases directly through the website.
- **Order Management:** Suppliers receive detailed orders submitted by buyers, including all necessary information to fulfil the requests.
- **Order Status Updates:** Suppliers can update the status of orders, providing real-time visibility for buyers about their purchases.

While the current state focuses on essential functionality, it sets the foundation for future enhancements that will make the platform more dynamic, efficient, and user-friendly.
## Development Tools

RedBazaar is being developed using a set of tools that streamline the coding, version control, and deployment processes. These tools ensure that development adheres to best practices and allows for efficient collaboration and deployment.

- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode):**  
  The primary IDE used for writing and managing the code. VSCode is enhanced with extensions such as:
  - **autoPEP8:** Automatically formats the code to comply with the PEP8 standard, ensuring clean and readable Python code.

- **Git:**  
  Used for version control, enabling the tracking of changes to the codebase and facilitating collaboration among developers.

- **GitHub:**  
  The repository for hosting the project, allowing for remote collaboration, issue tracking, and streamlined version management.

- **pip and `requirements.txt`:**  
  pip is used for managing project dependencies, with all necessary libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file for easy installation and environment setup.

- **Heroku:**  
  The platform used for deploying the project. Heroku allows for quick and scalable deployment, making it easy to share and test the application in a live environment.


## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Django:**  
  The primary framework used for building the backend of RedBazaar. Django handles the server-side logic, routing, and database interactions. It also includes a built-in authentication system for managing user registration and login.

- **Python:**  
  The core programming language for RedBazaar, used in conjunction with Django to build robust and scalable server-side functionality.

- **Django ORM and Database:**  
  Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is used for database operations. The database structure is managed entirely through Django, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

- **Django MPTT:**  
  This library is used for managing hierarchical data, particularly in creating parent and child categories for the products. It helps organise the categories into tree structures for better usability and data representation.

- **Django AllAuth:**  
  A library integrated for user authentication, registration, and login. It supports third-party authentication providers like Google and GitHub, allowing users to register with a single click.

### Frontend

- **HTML5:**  
  Used to structure the content of the website, ensuring semantic and accessible markup.

- **CSS3:**  
  Utilised to style the website, providing consistent and responsive designs across different devices.

- **JavaScript:**  
  Enhances interactivity on the site by enabling dynamic content updates and user interactions.

- **Bootstrap:**  
  A popular front-end framework that helps create responsive and visually appealing designs. Bootstrap is used for layout management, navigation bars, modals, and other UI components.

4. **As a buyer**, I want to track the status of my orders (e.g., pending, in process, dispatched, completed, rejected) to stay informed about their progress.

#### **Suppliers**
1. **As a supplier**, I want to receive orders from buyers through the platform to manage my sales efficiently.
2. **As a supplier**, I want to update the status of orders (e.g., pending, in process, dispatched, completed, rejected) to keep buyers informed about their progress.
3. **As a supplier**, I want all transactions to be handled securely and effectively, giving me confidence in the platform's reliability.

#### **System Administrators**

### Future Enhancements

As RedBazaar evolves, several advanced features are planned to enhance the platform and expand its functionality for both buyers and suppliers. The vision for RedBazaar includes:

- **QR Code Integration:** Buyers will be able to add products to their shopping lists by scanning QR codes. This will speed up the process and allow predefined quantities to be adjusted before completing purchases.
- **Smart Price Comparison Wizard:** A tool designed to help buyers optimise their shopping lists by identifying the best deals based on price, supplier ratings, or other preferences.
- **Calendar-Based Insights:** Both buyers and suppliers will have access to a calendar feature that leverages historical data:
  - Buyers will receive reminders about past purchases, such as increased orders for specific products during seasonal events, helping them plan more effectively.
  - Suppliers will be notified of past periods of high demand, allowing them to adjust their inventory, prepare special offers, or target specific customers more strategically.
- **Enhanced Supplier Visibility:** Suppliers will have the ability to promote their products and daily deals, ensuring maximum exposure on the platform.
- **API for Market Insights:** A free API will provide valuable analytics and trends for both buyers and suppliers, helping them make informed business decisions.
- **Dynamic Supplier Selection:** Buyers will have more flexibility in choosing suppliers, with tools that allow them to compare products and switch suppliers easily.

These future plans aim to make RedBazaar a comprehensive solution for connecting restaurants and suppliers, fostering growth and collaboration within the small and medium-sized business community.
